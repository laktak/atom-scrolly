Scrolly let's you scroll up and down while keeping the cursor on the same line. This is great to get a quick look at the lines that are off screen without loosing your position.

The functionality is basically the same as if you were using the mouse wheel.

apm install scrolly
```
or find it in the Packages tab under settings

## Usage Mac
